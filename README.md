A fake API is used to fetch product data. The application includes **Register, Login, Dashboard, and Cart** functionality with data persistence using **localStorage**.

After registering, the user data is stored in localStorage. The user can then log in and is redirected to the dashboard. On the dashboard, products are displayed where the user can **filter products by category**, **search products by name**, and **add products to the cart**. Cart data is also stored in localStorage so it persists even after page refresh.
